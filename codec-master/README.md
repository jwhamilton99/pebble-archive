# codec

A watchface based off the Codec from Metal Gear Solid.

The bars on the left would fill every 10 seconds, or would show the battery percentage if charging.

The "PTT" label shows the bluetooth status.

The numbers on the bottom left show the seconds, or the exact battery percentage if charging.
