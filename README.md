# pebble-archive

An archive of all my projects for the Pebble. This archive contains the last remaining images I could find of all my apps/watchfaces.

This is the first platform for which I made products that people could actually download and use. Feel free to explore around and take a look at the code!

Since I was so active, I received a free pre-production Pebble Time to test my apps on before launch:

Rest in peace, Pebble.
